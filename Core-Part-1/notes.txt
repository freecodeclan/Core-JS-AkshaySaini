Hoisting:   Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior in which variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase, before the code has been executed. It is like the variables and functions are "hoisted" or lifted to the top of the scope.

console.log(myVar); // Output: undefined
var myVar = 5;
console.log(myVar); // Output: 5
